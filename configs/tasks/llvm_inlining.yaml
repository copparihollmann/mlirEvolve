# LLVM inlining heuristic optimization task config

# Env vars are resolved at runtime by the evaluator (evaluate.py reads os.environ).
# Set these in your shell or .env:
#   LLVM_SRC_PATH   — path to llvm-project source
#   EVOLVE_BUILD_DIR — LLVM build directory for incremental rebuilds
#   BUILD_LLVM_DIR   — fallback for EVOLVE_BUILD_DIR
